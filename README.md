# USAMap
C++ USA Cities Map acts as a rudimentary version of Google Maps. Over 25,000 named places in the United States are organized into a hash table. Along with thousands of roads connecting the places to each other. 
Once the program reads all the input files regarding all the named places and the roads, the user is prompted to input the name of the places of the start and end positions. The program will then first search the hash table to see if both places exist in the database, and then it will execute the algorithm to find the shortest path between both locations if there exists one. Then it will draw a seperate graphics window of the appropritate size with the shortest path drawn on top of it. Also driving instructions will be printed in the console.
The necessary files in order to run the program are all provided especially the four database text files regarding the named places, intersections, road connections, and the coverage of the map tiles. Also all the map tiles are provided which are selected by the program for the smallest most appropiate map for whatever path is covered, so for example the continental US map will be selected for Key West to Seattle and the Florida map will be selected for Miami to Orlando.
Example screenshots are provided in a seperate folder to show all its functionality at different distances and map scales.
